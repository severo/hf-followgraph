            >
              Followgraph looks up all the people you follow on Hugging Face,
              and then the people <em>they</em> follow. Then it sorts them by
              the number of mutuals, or otherwise by how popular those accounts
              are.
              <br />
              It then shows the list with Hugging Face links to follow them.
            </FAQItem>

            <FAQItem title="Do I need to grant Followgraph any permissions?">
              Not at all! Followgraph uses public APIs to fetch potential people
              you can follow on Hugging Face. In fact, it only does
              inauthenticated network requests.
            </FAQItem>

            <FAQItem title="Help! The search got stuck.">
              Don&apos;t worry. The list of suggestions will load in 30 seconds
              or so. Sometimes it gets stuck because one or more of the queries
              made to Hugging Face time out. This is not a problem, because the
              rest of the queries will work as expected.
            </FAQItem>

            <FAQItem title="Why don't I see any results?">
              Make sure you have no typos in the Hugging Face handle, and make
              sure you follow at least a few people to seed the search.
            </FAQItem>

            <FAQItem title="How can I contribute with suggestions?">
              Click the &quot;Fork me on Github&quot; link on the top right, and
              open up an issue.
            </FAQItem>

            <FAQItem title="Why is this not a core Hugging Face feature?">
              Well, maybe it should be. In the meantime, you can use this
              website.
            </FAQItem>

            <FAQItem title="Can I download the list of accounts as CSV?">
              While it would be a useful feature, Followgraph does <em>not</em>{' '}
              plan to offer this functionality as it would facilitate inorganic
              and potentially malicious behaviour.
